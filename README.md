# Customer-Segmentation

#### The goal of the market segmentation project is to use machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their Personality Analysis, hoping they can tailor their marketing efforts to an ideal customer group and improve sales.

## Project Flow
* Clean the data by removing or replacing missing values, changing the datatypes
* Analysing Numerical and Categorical Variables to perform Dimension Reduction
* Data Standardization and Performing PCA
* Finding number of clusters by implementing elbow method
* Performing different Clustering Algorithms like K-means, Agglomerative Clustering, MeanShift, AffinityPropogation, SpectralClustering and Birch.
* Performance Evaluation (Silhouette Coefficient, Dunn Index)
* Interpretating Clusters for Segmentation
* Impact of Project outcomes
